# Directed Weighted Graph 

This project is similar to [Shorted path project](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/ShortedPathOnGraph) only this time the graph is directed and our workspace is on Python, the project have a classes that simulating a directional weighted graph with algorithms that manipulating it.
the graph is calculated to perform in the best way as possible and for doing that it is used with Dijkstra algorithms.
the project also have a test files for every class.

## Culculate the shortest path with Dijktra's algorithm
**see [Dijkstra's algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for more info.**

### For installing the project 
Get this [Directed Weighted Graph](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/DWGraph_Py) to your own computer with your workspace directory.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Idanturjeman/DWGraph_Py.git
```
